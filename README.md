OnSchedule

Online scheduling service created by 16skittles. Visible at schedule.16skittles.tk

To set it up, if you so desire, you would need to change the settings in the file "dbinfo.php" to the correct values for your servers. I think you'd need an SQL database formatted properly as well, but I'm new to this github thing. Going to stay on the side of caution of security. Maybe I'll add a blank database soon.
